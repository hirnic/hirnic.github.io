    <img src="C:\Users\Christian\Pictures\Christian_Headshot" alt="This is an image of a young white man with brown hair, parted on his left side. He is wearing a dark gray shirt with a wine-red bow tie. But not a pretied bow tie. His wife won't let him wear that type of bow tie. She says they are for five year olds. My cat has a bow tie collar. It is a pretied bow tie, but he is still a kitten, so it is okay.">
