    <h1>Christian Hirni</h1>

    <img src="C:\Users\Christian\Pictures\Christian_Headshot.jpg" alt="This is an image of a young white man with brown hair parted on his left side. He is wearing a dark gray shirt with a wine-red bow tie. But not a pretied bow tie. His wife won't let him wear that type of bow tie. She says they are for five year olds. My cat has a bow tie collar. It is a pretied bow tie, but he is still a kitten, so it is okay.">

    <p> My name is Christian. I thought my name was pretty uncommon, but apparently, I am not the only Christian Hirni alive in the United States. I use no social media outside LinkedIn, cell phone, and email.</p>
    <p> I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri in Columbia studying mathematics. I am married, and my wife and I have one cat. His name is Epsilon. But not $\epsilon$. I think that one looks weird, so I always type $\varepsilon$. His collar tag says $\varepsilon$ on it. He was named when he was really small. Epsilon is not small anymore, so I think it is safe to say the joke lost continuity (yes, that is a pun). We just call him slash now (short for "slash varepsilon").</p>
    <p>My hobbies are machine learning, video game developing, and studying music theory.</p>
